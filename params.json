It's a collaboration project with @everlastingbugstopper and Kris.\r\n\r\nIn my data structures and algorithms class, I wrote a recipe book program in java, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/beckmc/RecipeBook-CS150). Over the summer I made an objective-c version of it which implements a GUI and features some other changes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/beckmc/RecipeBook).\r\n***\r\n### Other Stuff\r\nSometimes I write things on Medium. You can find my profile at <https://medium.com/@mcbeckjr> and check out some of the things I have written there.\r\n***\r\n### Contact Me\r\nYou can get in touch with me at beckmc@lafayette.edu",
