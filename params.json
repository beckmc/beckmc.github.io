It was collaboration project with @everlastingbugstopper and Kris Blau, where I was in charge of the back-end of the project.\r\n\r\nIn my data structures and algorithms class, I wrote a recipe book program in Java, which you can learn more about [here](https://github.com/beckmc/RecipeBook-CS150). After the course ended, I made an Objective-C version of it which implements a GUI and features some other changes, which can be found [here](https://github.com/beckmc/RecipeBook).\r\n***\r\n### My Courses\r\n* CS 104 - Computer Gaming (Fall 2014)\r\n* CS 150 - Data Structures & Algorithms (Spring 2015)\r\n* CS 202 - Analysis of Algorithms (Fall 2015)\r\n* CS 203 - Computer Organization (Fall 2015)\r\n* CS 205 - Software Engineering (Spring 2016)\r\n* CS 301 - Principles of Programming Languages (Spring 2016)\r\n* CS 320 - Database Management Systems (Fall 2016)\r\n\r\n***\r\n### Other Stuff\r\nSometimes I write things about my other passion, politics, on Medium.
